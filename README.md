# TwoBits Donations
Mobile Application <br>
<br />
Two Bits is a round-up feature. Every time you make a purchase with a card, the charged amount is rounded up to the nearest quarter (e.g. “two bits”). So, on average it generates 12.5 cents a transaction.  Assuming you dip your card four times a day (a cup of coffee here, an online purchase there1), it generates 50 cents a day, or $150 a year! It’s not unreasonable to imagine a few million users generating a billion dollars a year, making Two Bits a powerful force for change. <br>
